# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 3

**Today's Progress**: I set up a Twilio account and practiced using it to send and receive text messages.

**Thoughts** It's really fun to be starting a project from scratch again but also a bit scary. I'm trying to remind myself that it's OK not to know up front exactly how all the technologies I'm using work or exactly what the finished product will look like; I'll figure this out as I go. The important thing is not how quick or direct the journey is but simply that I move forward or learn something new every day.

### Day 2: Tuesday, January 4

**Today's Progress**: Building on the Express server I started yesterday, I created a simple web page with a form that accepts a user input and sends it to the back end.

**Thoughts** It was nice to review Express and HTML forms because I'm a bit rusty on those. I like that HTML forms allow the user to submit information in multiple ways (e.g., hitting the Enter key rather than clicking), but I'm also remembering why so many devs dread them - it's inconvenient to have to override the default page-refreshing behavior of a submit event.

### Interim goals
* Create a website with a form for sending me text messages
* Or maybe just store my responses first? First in Firebase and then in Redis or a more robust SQL database (I don't need speed).
* Or is Twilio storing messages for me already?
* Try Phoenix Framework if throughput is high
