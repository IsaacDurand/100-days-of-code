# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 3

**Today's Progress**: I set up a Twilio account and practiced using it to send and receive text messages.

**Thoughts** It's really fun to be starting a project from scratch again but also a bit scary. I'm trying to remind myself that it's OK not to know up front exactly how all the technologies I'm using work or exactly what the finished product will look like; I'll figure this out as I go. The important thing is not how quick or direct the journey is but simply that I move forward or learn something new every day.
